If you find useful coding tips here then that is great, however, the main thing is to see how we use code/data analyses to answer **interesting biological questions**.\n\nSo explore the site, use it to help with your data analyses, but don't get bogged down in the code!\n\n## How to use this site\n\nUse the menu on the left to navigate the site.\n\nCode from each section can be copied using the clipboard symbol on the right of each 'code block' (the grey boxes). Function help pages can be accessed by clicking on a function name. You can try this below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"Success - too easy to copy and paste code\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## How to download and run the R scripts on your computer\n\nIf you are not a git/github user, you can use the following instructions to download and run the code on your computer.:\n\n### First create an RStudio project\n\nOpen RStudio and then follow these steps:\n\n-   Select the **File** menu followed by **New Project**\n\n-   Choose **New Directory** and then **New Project**\n\n-   Give the directory a name, for example, **ANIM5502_2022_local**, choose where to save the folder by selecting **Browse**, check the box next to **Open in new session**. Select **Create Project**.\n\n### Then run the following code whilst in the opened project\n\nRunning this code will download all the R scrips as well as the prepared data.\n\nNote: it will not download the Excel file that is needed to run the data_cleaning code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndownload.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdberson/ANIM5502_2022/main/code/ANIM_5502_local_setup.R\",\n              \"ANIM_5502_local_setup.R\")\n\nsource(\"ANIM_5502_local_setup.R\")\n```\n:::\n",

If you find useful coding tips here then that is great, however, the main thing is to see how we use code/data analyses to answer **interesting biological questions**.\n\nSo explore the site, use it to help with your data analyses, but don't get bogged down in the code!\n\n## How to use this site\n\nUse the menu on the left to navigate the site.\n\nCode from each section can be copied using the clipboard symbol on the right of each 'code block' (the grey boxes). Function help pages can be accessed by clicking on a function name. You can try this below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"Success - too easy to copy and paste code\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## How to download and run the R scripts on your computer\n\nIf you are not a git/github user, there are two ways to download the R scripts used on this website and run these locally:\n\n1.  Using the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) R Package to create a project specific library so that all packages are the same version as used here.\n2.  Using your system R library. This is a little simpler to set-up but results may differ slightly.\n\n### 1. Using renv\n\nFirst open RStudio and run the following code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"renv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen follow these steps:\n\n-   Select the **File** menu followed by **New Project**\n\n-   Choose **New Directory** and then **New Project**\n\n-   Give the directory a name, for example, **ANIM5502_2022_local**, choose where to save the folder by selecting **Browse**, check the boxes next to **Use renv with this project** as well as **Open in new session**. Select **Create Project**.\n\n-   In the newly opened RStudio session, open a new R script (**File** --\\> **New File** --\\> **R Script**), copy and paste the below R code and then select the **Source** button in the top right. When prompted to update packages, choose yes.\n\n-   You should see three .R files downloaded into the project folder (look at the **Files pane** in RStudio). The names of these files match to the pages on this website, except they each start with \"dung beetles\" and have underscores in place of spaces.\n\n-   Work through these downloaded .R files as you would any R scripts.\n\n-   Note: if you want to run the dung_beetles_data_cleaning.R script you will need to save the Excel file from the SharePoint in the project's \"data\" folder. The other two .R scripts do not need this Excel file.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # Download R scripts ------------------------------------------------------\n    \n    download.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdberson/ANIM5502_2022/main/code/dung_beetles_data_cleaning.R\",\n                  \"dung_beetles_data_cleaning.R\")\n    \n    download.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdberson/ANIM5502_2022/main/code/dung_beetles_data_exploration.R\",\n                  \"dung_beetles_data_exploration.R\")\n    \n    download.file(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdberson/ANIM5502_2022/main/code/dung_beetles_data_modelling.R\",\n                  \"dung_beetles_data_modelling.R\")\n    \n    \n    \n    # Download data -----------------------------------------------------------\n    \n    # Create a data folder \n    dir.create(\"data\")\n    \n    # Download Excel file\n    # The dung_beetles_data_cleaning.R script requires the Excel file to run.\n    # Download this from the SharePoint site and save in the \"data\" file of\n    # this project.

title: "Dung beetles"

This section shows the data analyses that could be used for the ANIM5502 dung beetle group project.

Check through the pages carefully, run the analyses yourself, and come to the next meeting ready with questions!

Note the figures and tables are generally in a rough and raw state. This reflects the iterative way I tend to work - produce a table/figure using (mostly) default settings and then improve it from there. I'm happy to chat about what needs to be done to improve presentation but I will leave it to each individual to produce their final results.

You will see that I've structured the data analysis in three parts - data cleaning, data exploration and data modelling. I've used pronotum width and a couple of hypotheses as examples that can be extended / modified.

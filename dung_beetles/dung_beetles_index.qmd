title: "Dung beetles"

This section shows the data analyses that could be used for the ANIM5502 dung beetle group project.

Check through the pages carefully, run the analyses yourself, and come to the next meeting ready with questions!

Note the figures have now been tidied up but tables are generally in a rough and raw state. Use the papers you are reading as a guide to how to present results in tables and within the body of the text.

You will see that I've structured the data analysis in three parts - data cleaning, data exploration and data modelling. I've used pronotum width and a couple of hypotheses as examples that can be extended / modified.
